# Wickr Webhook Bot

This project is a WickrIO integration created via [cookiecutter-wickr-bot](https://github.com/WickrInc/cookiecutter-wickr-bot)

## Installation

See the WickrIO [Getting Started Guide](https://wickrinc.github.io/wickrio-docs/#wickr-io-getting-started).

## Usage

Webhook Bot understands the following commands:

 - `/help` - Prints a help message with all available commands
 - `/show` - Show the webhook URL for the current room
 - `/rekey` - Rotate the current webhook URL for the room

### Sending a webhook message

The API is almost identical to the [Slack Incoming Webhooks API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#posting_with_webhooks).

``` bash
curl https://hooks.example.com/send/$KEY -d 'payload={"text": "hello world"}'
# or
curl https://hooks.example.com/send/$KEY -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"text": "hello world"}'
```

It also accepts webhooks in the [AWS Chime](https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-chime-developer-guide/blob/master/doc_source/webhooks.md) format:

``` bash
curl https://hooks.example.com/send/$KEY -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"Content": "hello world"}'
```

#### Simple Notification Service (SNS)

The Webhook Bot also supports use as an HTTPS subscription endpoint for Amazon SNS. It will automatically confirm subscription to the topic, and send the message body of the SNS Notification into the Wickr room. 

When configuring the subscription to your SNS topic, select the `HTTPS` protocol, enter in the HTTPS URL of the webhook receiver for your particular room, and ensure that raw message delivery is _not_ enabled on the subscription.

## Development

### Building

Run `make` to create a new `software.tar.gz` package, which can be installed as a WickrIO Custom Integration. See the [WickrIO docs](https://wickrinc.github.io/wickrio-docs/#developing-integrations-creating-an-integration-locally) for more details.
